# Hi, I'm Rosie Ha Vu! 👋

💻 **Master of IT | Human-Computer Interaction @ UniMelb**  
A design engineer who aims to humanize technology and build user-centric products.

## About me
My journey begins with the passion for combining technology and psychology in the data-driven world and bridge the gap between them. My ultimate goal is to humanize technology and build user-centric products that foster meaningful engagement and take mental well-being into account. 

To me, technology is not a tool but rather an extension of human behavior, one that should empower, not overwhelm. Having worked across the product lifecycle, I ensure that products are not only functional, but also engaging, accessible, and built for long-term success.

When I'm not coding, you will find me [writing](https://omniscient-gate-2e9.notion.site/Ha-Vu-s-Creative-Portfolio-1d0b894888b28002acb2e01651b4eb54?pvs=74), travelling, cooking with mom, running with dad, hiking with tuki, or chatting with my brother Khoi.
